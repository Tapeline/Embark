# Prebuilt playbooks

If you have an archive and/or a folder with `embark.exe`, `playbook.yml` and
lots of other files, then it's probably a playbook that has been assembled
for you to quickly deploy it.


## Launching the playbook

In order to launch the playbook, just double-click the `embark.exe` file.
It will ask for administrative permissions, you should grant them, because
playbooks are intended to modify your apps and system, thus these permissions
are needed.

When you double-click the file, a screen will appear:

Click on the desired playbook button. The main screen will appear.

On the right, you can see how the playbook execution is going:
- ✅ - task is done
- ⌛ - task is running
- ❔ - task is pending
- ❌ - task has failed
- ⏩ - task was skipped
